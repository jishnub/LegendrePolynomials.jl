# Introduction

Compute [Legendre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials), [Associated Legendre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Legendre_polynomials), and their derivatives using a 3-term recursion relation (Bonnet’s recursion formula).

```math
P_\ell(x) = \left((2\ell-1) x P_{\ell-1}(x) - (\ell-1)P_{\ell - 2}(x)\right)/\ell
```

By default this package evaluates the standard polynomials that satisfy ``P_\ell(1) = 1`` and ``P_0(x) = 1``. These are normalized as

```math
\int_{-1}^1 P_m(x) P_n(x) dx = \frac{2}{2n+1} \delta_{mn}.
```

Optionally, normalized polynomials may be evaluated that have an L2 norm of `1`.

Analogous to Legendre polynomials, one may evaluate associated Legendre polynomials using a 3-term recursion relation. This is evaluated by iterating over the normalized associated Legendre functions, and multiplying the norm at the final stage. Such an iteration avoids floating-point overflow.

The relation used in evaluating normalized associated Legendre polynomials ``\bar{P}_{\ell}^{m}\left(x\right)`` is

```math
\bar{P}_{\ell}^{m}\left(x\right)=\alpha_{\ell m}\left(x\bar{P}_{\ell-1}^{m}\left(x\right)-\frac{1}{\alpha_{\ell-1m}}\bar{P}_{\ell-2}^{m}\left(x\right)\right),
```

where
```math
\alpha_{\ell m}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(2\ell+1\right)\left(2\ell-1\right)}{\left(\ell-m\right)\left(\ell+m\right)}},
```

The starting value for a specific ``m`` is obtained by setting ``\ell = m``, in which case we use the explicit relation

```math
\bar{P}_{m}^{m}\left(x\right)=\left(-1\right)^{m}\left(2m-1\right)!!\sqrt{\frac{\left(2m+1\right)}{2\left(2m\right)!}}\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{\left(m/2\right)}.
```

The polynomials, thus defined, include the Condon-Shortley phase ``(-1)^m``, and may be evaluated using the standard normalization as

```math
P_{\ell}^{m}\left(x\right)=\sqrt{\frac{2\left(\ell+m\right)!}{\left(2\ell+1\right)\left(\ell-m\right)!}}\bar{P}_{\ell}^{m}\left(x\right).
```

There are six main functions:

* [`Pl(x,l; [norm = Val(:standard)])`](@ref Pl): this evaluates the Legendre polynomial for a given degree `l` at the argument `x`. The argument needs to satisfy `-1 <= x <= 1`.
* [`collectPl(x; lmax, [lmin = 0], [norm = Val(:standard)])`](@ref collectPl): this evaluates all the polynomials for `l` lying in `0:lmax` at the argument `x`. As before the argument needs to lie in the domain of validity. Functionally this is equivalent to `Pl.(x, lmin:lmax)`, except `collectPl` evaluates the result in one pass, and is therefore faster. There is also the in-place version [`collectPl!`](@ref) that uses a pre-allocated array.
* [`Plm(x, l, m; [norm = Val(:standard)])`](@ref Plm): this evaluates the associated Legendre polynomial ``P_\ell^m(x)`` at the argument ``x``. The argument needs to satisfy `-1 <= x <= 1`.
* [`collectPlm(x; m, lmax, [lmin = abs(m)], [norm = Val(:standard)])`](@ref collectPlm): this evaluates the associated Legendre polynomials with coefficient `m` for `l = lmin:lmax`. There is also an in-place version [`collectPlm!`](@ref) that uses a pre-allocated array.
* [`dnPl(x, l, n)`](@ref dnPl): this evaluates the ``n``-th derivative of the Legendre polynomial ``P_\ell(x)`` at the argument ``x``. The argument needs to satisfy `-1 <= x <= 1`.
* [`collectdnPl(x; n, lmax)`](@ref collectdnPl): this evaluates the ``n``-th derivative of all the Legendre polynomials for `l = 0:lmax`. There is also an in-place version [`collectdnPl!`](@ref) that uses a pre-allocated array.

# Quick Start

Evaluate the Legendre polynomial for one `l` at an argument`x` as `Pl(x, l)`:

```jldoctest
julia> p = Pl(0.5, 3)
-0.4375

julia> p ≈ -7/16 # analytical value
true
```

Evaluate the associated Legendre Polynomial one `l,m` pair as `Plm(x, l, m)`:

```jldoctest
julia> p = Plm(0.5, 3, 2)
5.624999999999997

julia> p ≈ 45/8 # analytical value
true
```

Evaluate the `n`th derivative of `Pl` for one `l` as `dnPl(x, l, n)`:

```jldoctest
julia> dnPl(0.5, 3, 2)
7.5
```

Evaluate the Legendre polynomials for `l` in `lmin:lmax` as `collectPl(x; lmin, lmax)`.
By default `lmin` is chosen to be `0`, and may be omitted.

```jldoctest
julia> collectPl(0.5, lmax = 3)
4-element OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:3) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:3:
  1.0
  0.5
 -0.125
 -0.4375
```

Evaluate the associated Legendre Polynomials for order `m` and degree `l` in `lmin:lmax`
as `collectPlm(x; m, lmin, lmax)`. By default `lmin` is chosen to be `abs(m)`, and may be omitted.

```jldoctest
julia> collectPlm(0.5, lmax = 5, m = 3)
3-element OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 3:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 3:5:
  -9.742785792574933
 -34.09975027401223
 -42.62468784251535
```

Evaluate all the `n`th derivatives of `Pl` as `collectdnPl(x; lmax, n)`:

```jldoctest
julia> collectdnPl(0.5, lmax = 5, n = 3)
6-element OffsetArray(::Vector{Float64}, 0:5) with eltype Float64 with indices 0:5:
  0.0
  0.0
  0.0
 15.0
 52.5
 65.625
